# Neubot

Neubot (the network neutrality bot) is a free-software Internet bot, developed and maintained by the Nexa Center for Internet and Society, that gathers network performance data useful to investigate network neutrality. Once installed, it runs in the background and periodically performs active transmission tests with M-Lab servers. Three tests are currently implemented: \`speedtest', that emulates HTTP; \`bittorrent',
that emulates BitTorrent; and \`raw\`, that performs a raw TCP test.
