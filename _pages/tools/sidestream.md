# SideStream

Collects statistics about the TCP connections used by the measurement tools running on the M-Lab platform. Sidestream runs as a "side" addition to other tools, taking advantage of TCP connections generated by incoming tests to M-Lab.

**Data** collected by SideStream is available...

- in raw format at <https://storage.cloud.google.com/m-lab/sidestream>
- via an SQL interface (see <https://github.com/m-lab/mlab-wikis/blob/master/BigQueryMLabDataset.md>).

**Source code** is available at <https://github.com/npad/sidestream>.
