# Pathload2

Pathload2 determines the available bandwidth of your Internet connection, in both the upstream and downstream directions. Unlike many other "speed tests," Pathload2 uses active probing methodologies to estimate available bandwidth in a way that does not depend on a specific protocol or application.

## Pathload2 has been decommissioned on 21/12/2012. The source code and the data are still available at the links provided below.

Pathload2 measures the available bandwidth of your Internet connection. The available bandwidth is the maximum bit rate you can send to a network link before it gets congested.

**Data** collected by Pathload2 is available in raw format atÂ <https://storage.cloud.google.com/m-lab/pathload2>.

**Source code** is available at <https://code.google.com/p/pathload2-gatech/>.
